The tool supports the following options:
```
USAGE:
   ragno [commands] [options...]

COMMANDS:
   discv4   discover4 prints nodes in the discovery4 network
   run      run connects to nodes provided in csv file and save into postgresql database

```

# Docker
#### Build and run the database alongside ragno:
These containers are configured with a `.env` file. See `.env.example` for examples on the parameters.

`docker compose up db ragno`

#### Build and run Prometheus metrics database (exposed at `:9090`):
This container is configured with a `./prometheus/prometheus.yml` file. View `./prometheus/prometheus.yml.example` for a template.

`docker compose up prometheus`

If any container fails to start, make sure you granted permissions to the data folder with:
`sudo chmod 777 ./app-data/*_db`

# Prometheus
[Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/docs/introduction/overview/) is what is used to gather metrics periodically from the recollected data. By default, they can be viewed at `:9070/metrics`.

#### Current available metrics:

| name                                       | description
|--------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------
| `crawler_observed_client_distribution`     | Number of nodes using the clients seen.
| `crawler_client_version_distribution`      | Number of nodes from each of the client's versions.
| `crawler_geographical_distribution`        | Number of nodes from each country.
| `crawler_node_distribution`                | Total number of nodes.
| `crawler_deprecated_nodes`                 | Total number of deprecated nodes.
| `crawler_os_distribution`                  | OS distribution of connected nodes.
| `crawler_arch_distribution`                | Architecture distribution of the active nodes in the network.
| `crawler_hosted_peers_distribution`        | Distribution of nodes that are hosted on non-residential networks.

# Migrate
To move between database versions, use [go migrate](https://github.com/golang-migrate/migrate/).

In case of any database conflict, you can still force a specific version:

`migrate -path / -database "postgresql://username:secretkey@localhost:5432/database_name?sslmode=disable" force <version>`

If specific upgrades or downgrades need to be done manually, one could do this with:

`migrate -path database/migration/ -database "postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/database_name?sslmode=disable" -verbose up`

# Notes
Be careful with the input and output csv file names, since the `discv4` command will take `output.csv` by default.

Also, please note that the tool is currently in a developing stage. Any bugs report and/or suggestions are very welcome.
